Installation cannot proceed. There appears to be an application monitor that will automatically restart Chrome if it shuts down unexpectedly and this monitor will conflict with this installation. The application monitor must be removed in order for this installation to complete.  If you need assistance with your installation please post any questions that you might have to http://community.risevision.com. Thank You!
